# AI Agents

As agent workloads become more complex, coordinating and verifying LLM interactions becomes increasingly critical. Traditional approaches lack provable guarantees about agent behaviors, making it difficult to audit decision chains or ensure consistent operation across distributed deployments. Fireproof's architecture addresses these challenges by providing a foundation for provable AI agent collaboration that extends classical state machine patterns with cryptographic verification and causal consistency.

Each agent interaction is modeled as a series of ledger updates that capture not just final outputs but the complete decision chain, including intermediate states, tool usage, and inter-agent communications. State transitions are recorded as cryptographically signed ledger entries, allowing any observer to verify the authenticity and sequence of agent decisions. The CRDT-based merge system enables agents to operate concurrently while maintaining a consistent state, essential for complex workflows where multiple agents may be working simultaneously from different compute endpoints.

This architecture enables sophisticated AI collaboration patterns that would be difficult to achieve with traditional databases. Multi-agent task orchestration becomes more reliable through provable completion states. Development teams can perform deterministic replay of agent decision processes for debugging or optimization. Cross-runtime agent collaboration maintains cryptographic verification of all interactions, while tool-use logging creates complete provenance chains for compliance and audit. The result is an architecture that supports the rapid evolution of AI systems while providing the stability and auditability required for production deployments.
