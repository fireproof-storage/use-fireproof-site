# Working with Files

If you add an upload `<input>` to your html like this:

```html
<input accept="image/*" title="save to Fireproof" type="file" id="files" multiple>
```

And an event handler:

```js
function handleFiles() {
  const fileList = this.files;
  const doc = {
    type: "files",
    _files: {}
  }
  for (const file of fileList) {
    // assign the File object to the document
    // under doc._files["myname.jpeg"]
    doc._files[file.name] = file
  }
  const ok = database.put(doc);
}

const fileInput = document.getElementById("files");
fileInput.addEventListener("change", handleFiles, false);
```

Fireproof will take care of encoding the file to UnixFS, encrypting it, and replicating with your chosen storage backend. Files are synced outside the main database, so they replicate on-demand and then are made available offline via the database. By default the files are encrypted, so they are safe to store in untrusted storage. 

### Load file data 

Uploaded files are available as a `File` object, which you can access by calling the `file()` method on the file metadata.

```js
await doc._files["myname.jpeg"].file()
```

The document looks like:

```js
{
  _id: "my-doc",
  _files: {
    "myname.jpeg": {
      type: "image/jpeg",
      size: 12345,
      file: () => Promise<File>
    }
  }
}
```

In the example below, note how we use `await` to get the file from the promise, and also that we've wrapped each file in an async function so the images can load in parallel. The user of `revokeObjectURL` is important to avoid memory leaks. [Here is a React component that handles this](https://github.com/fireproof-storage/catbot/blob/cd8056121bc42fa71a078b8501b5cfb2ed4fc7b3/src/components/ChatBubbles.tsx#L79).

```js
const doc = await database.get(ok.id)

// adjust this for your app
const li = document
            .querySelector('ul')
            .appendChild(document.createElement('li'))

for (const file of Object.keys(doc._files)) {
  (async () => {
    const meta = doc._files[file]
    if (meta.file && /image/.test(meta.type)) {
      const img = document.createElement("img");
      img.src = URL.createObjectURL(await meta.file());
      img.height = 100;
      img.onload = () => {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(img.src);
      };
      li.appendChild(img);
    }
  })();
}
```

#### Public Files

The public files API looks just like above, except you save to `doc._publicFiles` instead of `doc._files` and the files are not encrypted. This is useful for storing files that you want to share with the world, like images for your website. In addition to the `car`, `cid`, and `size` properties, public files also have a `url` property that you can use to access the file directly from the web3.storage content delivery network. 

The feature is designed to support systems like self-publishing blogs, which can write their own markdown to html output, reference assets, etc. The default encrpyted `_files` interface is better suited to social media sharing, field data collection, and other controlled access data sharing.

The public file feature is only available on the IPFS connector.
