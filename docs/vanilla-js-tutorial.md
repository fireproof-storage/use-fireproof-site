# JavaScript Tutorial

In this tutorial we wil make a to-do app in plain HTML and JavaScript, using Fireproof to save and then share our to-dos.

## Installation

We'll start our app with an empty HTML page and bring in Fireproof with a script tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <title>To-Do App with Fireproof</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fireproof/core/dist/browser/fireproof.iife.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
