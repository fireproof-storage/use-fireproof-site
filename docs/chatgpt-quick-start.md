# ChatGPT Builders

Fireproof is explicitly designed to be useful without requiring any setup or configuration. This makes it especially easy for ChatGPT to use, because Fireproof apps don't need to have a lot of hidden logic outside of the React code. Keep reading for pointers on how to leverage ChatGPT when writing code that uses Fireproof.

## AI writing Fireproof code

If you are coding with Fireproof, try pasting our LLMS.txt into your AI enabled code editor. We've founding using  Fireproof makes one-shot success more likely.

We've also created a "GPT" below, but we find writing code makes more sense in an AI enabled editor.

## üé® Vibe Coding with ChatGPT Canvas

ChatGPT Canvas is a powerful tool for "vibe coding" - where you describe the app you want to build in natural language, and AI helps bring it to life. This approach is particularly effective with Fireproof because of its zero-setup nature. You can describe your data model, UI components, and functionality, and Canvas will generate complete, working code without worrying about complex backend configurations.

The Canvas interface allows you to iteratively refine your app, making it perfect for rapid prototyping and experimentation. You can quickly test different approaches, UI designs, and data structures without getting bogged down in implementation details.

Ready to try vibe coding with Fireproof? Check out our [Vibe Coding with Fireproof GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67bd0ebe210081918561667c08662d03-vibe-coding-with-fireproof) which is specially designed to help you create Fireproof-powered applications through natural conversation.

## üèó Start building

The experts builders are preloaded with [code sandbox links](https://codesandbox.io/s/fireproof-react-antd-f6zbi7?file=/src/App.tsx) and API expertise, so you should be able to get a working prototype without leaving your browser.

Once you've chosen a builder, click the button to continue the conversation. You can then use the conversation to generate code for your app.
