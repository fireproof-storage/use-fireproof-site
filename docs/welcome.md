# Welcome

[Fireproof](https://fireproof.storage) is an embedded database designed to bring **live data anywhere**. Quickly add live data to any app or page with our embedded database, reducing risk, cost, and complexity with provable secure synchronization using any backend.

**Faster:** Local-first zero latency database queries

**Cheaper:** Zero-setup development with minimal operational costs

**Safer:** End-to-end encrypted with cryptographic integrity

Developers want to build features, not maintain complex stacks. Fireproof eliminates the traditional database setup, maintenance, and operations overhead, allowing developers to focus on building rich, local-first, collaborative apps. Fireproof turns any storage into an end-to-end encrypted, tamperproof ledger, empowering developers to build trustworthy apps that run anywhere with minimal operational cost and risk.

## Getting Started

All it takes is:

```bash
npm install use-fireproof
```

And in your JavaScript or TypeScript file:

```js
import { fireproof } from 'use-fireproof'

const { database } = fireproof("my-database")

database.put({ hello: 'world' })

const { docs } = await database.query("_id")

console.log(docs)
```


### What is Fireproof?

Fireproof uses immutable data and distributed protocols to offer a new kind of database that:

- can be embedded in any page or app, with a flexible data ownership model
- can be hosted on any cloud
- uses cryptographically verifiable protocols (what plants crave)
